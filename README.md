# Recommendation Systems Projects

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a **pre-existing Recommendation Systems project** that I have downloaded from an open-source source and uploaded here for learning and exploration purposes.  
The project demonstrates how to build personalized recommendation engines using various techniques like **TF‑IDF + Nearest Neighbors**, **vectorization**, and **Streamlit apps** for interactive use.

> ⚠️ Note: I did **not create this project myself**, it is used here solely for learning and demonstration.
